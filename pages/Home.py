        This demo showcases a multi-page Streamlit app where:
        - All page content files are in the `pages/` directory.
        - `app.py` uses `st.navigation` and `st.Page` for explicit control.
        - Each page file has an `if __name__ in ("__main__", "__page__"): main()` block.

        **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a page from the sidebar** to explore.

        ### What's inside?
        - **Home Page (`Home.py`):** This page you're currently viewing.
        - **Dashboard Page (`Dashboard.py`):** A simple page with a chart and some metrics.
        - **Analysis Page (`Analysis.py`):** A page demonstrating text input and display.

        - **Organization:** All pages are neatly grouped in `pages/`.
        - **Control:** `app.py` dictates the order, titles, and icons.
        - **Modularity:** Each page can be run independently for testing.
